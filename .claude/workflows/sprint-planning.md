# SPRINT PLANNING WORKFLOW

## Overview
Comprehensive sprint planning process using Claude CLI to analyze capacity, prioritize features, and create realistic sprint goals.

## üóìÔ∏è Schedule
**Frequency:** Every 2 weeks (Monday)  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Participants:** Senior Dev + 3 Interns + CEO (for priorities)

## üìã Pre-Planning Preparation (Day Before)

### Automated Analysis
```bash
# Sprint retrospective analysis
claude "Analyze last sprint performance:
- Velocity actual vs. planned
- Story points completed vs. committed
- Types of work that took longer than expected
- Blockers that consumed time
- Team satisfaction and learnings
- Technical debt accumulated"

# Backlog grooming
claude "Prepare backlog for planning:
- Prioritize items by business value
- Identify dependencies between items
- Estimate effort for unestimated items
- Flag items needing more requirements
- Identify technical risks"

# Capacity analysis
claude "Calculate team capacity for next sprint:
- Available person-days (accounting for holidays/PTO)
- Velocity trend from last 3 sprints
- Buffer for unexpected issues (20% recommended)
- Time allocated for code reviews and mentoring
- Learning/training time needed"
```

### Data Gathering
```markdown
üìä **SPRINT METRICS TO REVIEW:**
- Previous sprint velocity: X story points
- Team capacity: X person-days
- Critical bugs backlog: X items
- Technical debt items: X hours estimated
- New feature requests: X items
- Performance/security issues: X items
```

## üéØ Sprint Planning Session

### Phase 1: Sprint Review & Retrospective (30 minutes)

#### What Went Well
```bash
claude "Generate 'What Went Well' analysis:
- Features delivered successfully
- Processes that worked effectively
- Technical solutions that solved problems well
- Team collaboration highlights
- Learning achievements
- Tools/practices that helped productivity"
```

#### What Didn't Go Well
```bash
claude "Identify improvement areas:
- Features that faced unexpected challenges
- Processes that slowed us down
- Technical decisions that created problems
- Communication gaps
- Knowledge gaps that created blockers
- Tools/practices that hindered productivity"
```

#### Action Items from Retrospective
```markdown
**Process Improvements for Next Sprint:**
- [ ] Improvement 1: [Specific action + owner]
- [ ] Improvement 2: [Specific action + owner]
- [ ] Improvement 3: [Specific action + owner]

**Technical Improvements:**
- [ ] Tool/practice to adopt: [Details]
- [ ] Tool/practice to stop: [Reason]
- [ ] Knowledge sharing session: [Topic + presenter]
```

### Phase 2: Sprint Goal Definition (20 minutes)

#### Business Priorities (CEO Input)
```markdown
**Sprint Theme:** [One sentence describing the main focus]

**Business Objectives:**
1. **Primary Goal:** [Most important business outcome]
2. **Secondary Goal:** [Supporting business outcome]
3. **Technical Goal:** [Critical technical improvement needed]

**Success Metrics:**
- Metric 1: [Specific measurable outcome]
- Metric 2: [Specific measurable outcome]
- Metric 3: [Specific measurable outcome]
```

#### Technical Priorities (Senior Dev Input)
```bash
claude "Based on current technical state, prioritize:
1. Critical security fixes (blocking production)
2. Performance issues affecting users
3. Technical debt reducing team velocity
4. Infrastructure/tooling improvements
5. New feature development capacity"
```

### Phase 3: Capacity Planning (15 minutes)

#### Team Capacity Analysis
```bash
claude "Calculate realistic sprint capacity:

**Available Time:**
- Senior Dev: X days (minus Y days for code reviews/mentoring)
- Frontend Intern: X days (minus Y days for learning)
- Backend Intern: X days (minus Y days for learning)
- Full-stack Intern: X days (minus Y days for testing/docs)

**Capacity Adjustments:**
- New team member learning curve: -20%
- Technical debt from last sprint: -15%
- Integration complexity: -10%
- Buffer for unexpected issues: -20%

**Realistic Capacity:** X story points"
```

#### Skill-based Allocation
```markdown
**Frontend Work Capacity:**
- CSS optimization: 8 hours (Frontend Intern)
- JavaScript debugging: 12 hours (Frontend Intern)
- Mobile responsiveness: 6 hours (Frontend Intern)
- UI component development: 10 hours (Frontend Intern)

**Backend Work Capacity:**
- Security implementations: 16 hours (Backend Intern + Senior Dev)
- Database optimization: 8 hours (Backend Intern)
- API development: 12 hours (Backend Intern)
- Integration work: 6 hours (Backend Intern)

**Full-stack Work Capacity:**
- Testing suite: 10 hours (Full-stack Intern)
- Documentation: 6 hours (Full-stack Intern)
- Integration testing: 8 hours (Full-stack Intern)
- Performance monitoring: 4 hours (Full-stack Intern)
```

### Phase 4: Story Selection & Estimation (45 minutes)

#### Critical Items (Must Do)
```bash
claude "Identify critical items for this sprint:
- Security fixes that block production deployment
- Critical bugs affecting user experience
- Dependencies for other team members
- Commitments to stakeholders with deadlines"
```

#### Story Estimation Process
```markdown
**Estimation Guidelines:**
- 1 point = 2-4 hours (simple task)
- 2 points = 4-8 hours (straightforward feature)
- 3 points = 8-16 hours (moderate complexity)
- 5 points = 16-24 hours (complex feature)
- 8 points = 24-40 hours (very complex - consider breaking down)

**Estimation Factors:**
- Technical complexity
- Requirements clarity
- Dependencies on other work
- Testing requirements
- Documentation needs
- Learning curve for implementer
```

#### Sprint Backlog Creation
```bash
claude "Create balanced sprint backlog:
1. Allocate critical items first
2. Balance between bug fixes and new features
3. Ensure each team member has appropriate work
4. Include learning objectives for interns
5. Leave 20% capacity for unexpected work
6. Verify dependencies are manageable"
```
